> The "wordlist" data within the project offers a comprehensive range of password combinations automatically generated using advanced encryption and security techniques. These combinations serve as a critical resource for identifying potential vulnerabilities, testing password strength, and conducting in-depth attack simulations. The wordlist data supports a robust password-cracking process, enabling users to enhance their security levels while proactively identifying and mitigating potential threats. Moreover, this data significantly demonstrates detection capabilities, revealing security weaknesses with high precision.

| Potential Password Combination
--------------------------------------------

A = Animal Name / Everyday Item / Hobby
B = Work / Sport / Team / Special Day / Date
C = Important Person / Character / Celebrity
D = Numbers / Special Characters
N = Username (let's take Jessica as an example)

The cipher is based on the following formula
--------------------------------------------

🔳 Cipher1 = N + B + D + C
🔑 Jessica1992*Barca

🔳 Cipher2 = C + D + N + A + B
🔑 Barca/JessicaCat1992

🔳 Cipher3 = N + A + B + C + D
🔑 JessicaCat1992Barca.

🔳 Cipher4 = D + N
🔑 155664jessica

🔳 Cipher4 = B + N + D
🔑 1995Jessica*
